This is my implementation of the first assignment for the Udacity "Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree".

# Instructions
1. Run main.py
2. (Optional) Open "fresh_tomatoes.html" (Should open automatically)

# Citations
I'm not sure how much I need to cite. I didn't borrow from anyone else's code per se, but I did have to rely on several python tutorials to re-learn the syntax:
1. "A Beginner's Python Tutorial": https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Beginner%27s_Python_Tutorial
2. "Learn Python the Hard Way": http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex40.html
3. "Python Documentation": https://docs.python.org
